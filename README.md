- 👋 Hi, I’m @steelrib
- 👀 I’m interested in wed development! And making music...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code via the freecodecamp.org...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something soon!!! I've been focused mostly on HTML and CSS, and can't compare to most of the folks on here...... I have dabbled in Javascript,
but am going to earnestly break in to it soon.
